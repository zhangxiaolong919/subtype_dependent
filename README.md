# subtype_dependent
Subtype dependent biomarker identification aims to identify subset of genes for each tumor subtype, in contrast to most of existing feature selection methods that obtain a common subet of genes for all tumor subtypes.
To run the program, users are required to install the mutual information toolbox (to compute mutal information, available at http://home.penglab.com/software/Hanchuan_Peng_Software/software.html) and LIBSVM toolbox (available at http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/index.html).
